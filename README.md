# Safeway Coupon Auto-clipper

A [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/) userscript that will automatically clip your [Just For U](https://www.safeway.com/foru/coupons-deals.html) coupons from [Safeway](https://www.safeway.com).

## Getting Started

> [!TIP]
> Changes to the Safeway website can break this userscript. Please double check that your coupons have been clipped before going shopping!
> 
> Please submit a bug report [here](https://github.com/NeurekaSoftware/Safeway-Coupon-Auto-Clipper/issues) if you have any issues.

### Install a Userscript Manager

Before you can install the Safeway Coupon Auto-clipper, you need to install a Userscript Manager extension for your desktop web browser.

I highly recommend that you use [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/).

### Install Safeway Coupon Auto-clipper

1) Open the Safeway Coupon Auto-clipper [installer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeurekaSoftware/Safeway-Coupon-Auto-Clipper/main/auto-clipper.user.js).
2) Click install on the page that opens, or press `Ctrl` + `Enter`.

### Start Saving!

Now, all you have to do is visit the [Safeway Just For U](https://www.safeway.com/foru/coupons-deals.html) website and make sure you're logged into your Safeway account.

Safeway Coupon Auto-clipper will load all of the available coupons and clip them for you every time you visit.
