A [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/) userscript that will automatically clip your [Just For U](https://www.safeway.com/foru/coupons-deals.html) coupons for [Safeway](https://www.safeway.com).

### Install a Userscript Manager

Before you can install the Safeway Coupon Auto-clipper, you need to install a Userscript Manager extension for your desktop web browser.

I highly recommend that you use [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/).

### Install Safeway Coupon Auto-clipper

1) Click the Violentmonkey icon in your browser and then click the cog wheel to open the Violentmonkey dashboard.

2) Click the `+` icon in the top left of your screen and click `Install from URL`.

3) Paste in the following URL and you're ready to go!

### Start Saving!

Now, all you have to do is visit the [Safeway Just For U](https://www.safeway.com/foru/coupons-deals.html) website and make sure you're logged into your Safeway account. Safeway Coupon Auto-clipper will load all of the available coupons and clip them for you every time you visit.
